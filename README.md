The Car Rental System is a desktop application developed in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLite for data storage. It is designed to simplify and automate the process of managing car rentals for both administrators and customers.

For customers, the system provides features to view available cars with their details, rent vehicles for a chosen number of days, calculate rental costs automatically, and return cars with the option to leave feedback. Each booking is stored in the customer database along with rental duration, total cost, and customer information.

For administrators, the system includes a secure login portal where they can add new cars, update vehicle information, upload images, assign drivers, and remove cars from the fleet. The application also ensures that cars cannot be double-booked by keeping real-time rental status.

Additionally, the system supports database backup and restore using JSON files, ensuring data safety and easy recovery. With its intuitive GUI, automated workflows, and integrated reporting, the Car Rental System provides a complete solution for small to medium-sized rental businesses, reducing manual work while improving 
efficiency and customer satisfaction.
